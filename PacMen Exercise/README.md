# PacMen Exercise Project
## Project's Overview
In this Pacmen project, I was able to expand my knowledge and softskills when creating a pacman image. Using the DOM library and Node.js, each pacman was able to move in random directions where it can be used according to speed.

How to Run:

1. Start by creating a pacman on the top left hand corner by clicking on "Add Pacman" button
2. Once pacman is created, you can click "Start Game" button to move and increase the speed of the pacman's motion.
3. In addition, you can create as many pacmen you like and click, "Start Game" to move them around in different directions.
